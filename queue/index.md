# Queue

They are flexible and are also flexible in regards to their size, they are also very similar to a stack, the key difference is the way how data is removed from them, a queue uses a first in first out approach or FIFO approach. One way to visualize a queue is to imagine a line of people waiting to purchase their groceries at a grocery store. The people who get into line first are the people who get served at the checkout stand first.
