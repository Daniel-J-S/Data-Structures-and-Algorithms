# What are Stacks?

A great example implementation of a stack is our browser's back button

Here's the most common methods we'll need for a Stack data structure

- `push` - Pushes a new piece of data on top of the Stack
- `pop` - Removes data from the top of the Stack
- `peek` - Returns data from the top of the Stack 
- `length` - Returns the length of the Stack

In JavaScript, the Array Object has a close resemblance to a Stack, so it's unlikely we'd need to implement a Stack on our own. However, for the purpose of this walkthrough, let's do it anyways.

Here's an example of a very simple Stack data structure using a JavaScipt class.
